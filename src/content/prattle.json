  "description": "As part of my Foundations of Software Engineering course, three other students and I spent half of the semester designing and building a web-based chat application to gain practical experience with concepts and tools explored during our lectures. The project was an opportunity to explore the Agile methodology, which included planning, outlining sprint goals, development and the opportunity for each team member to be Scrum Mater. Built over the course of 4 weeks, prattle includes a handful of modern technologies and tools to create a fully functional messaging application.",
  "design_summary": "Enjoying design as much as development, I decided to use this opportunity to research, design and implement an interface that would be modern and intuitive. Gathering inspiration from the Dribble, I created a set of interfaces to illustrate some of the core features of the application. Final designs were the product of an interative process and exploration following latest design trends and successful interfaces of established products such as Slack.",
  "build_summary": "prattle is built using a variety of tools, programming and scripting languages. Following the principles of object-oriented programming and test-driven development, we built the application following a bottom-up approach; using the MVC pattern, we started with our central components and created the foundation for the application. We also placed a lot of emphasis on following good coding practices such as writing DRY code, provide clear and detailled documentation and performing code review among team members.",
