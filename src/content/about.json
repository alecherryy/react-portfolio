    "intro": "My name is Alessia, I am a front end and software engineer based out of New York, NY. Born and raised in Italy, I came to the US in 2011. Since then, I have lived in Miami for 5 years and Seattle for another 3. I travelled up and down the country, visited as many cities and national parks as possible; my favorite place is Utah. It's a national park galore.",
    "content": "I currently work full-time for Forum One, a digital agency headquartered in Crystal City, VA. I have been working for Forum One for over 2 years; over this time, I had the pleasure to work with local, state and federal government as well as many non-profit organizations. I am also pursuing a Master in Computer Science at Northeastern University with a focus on Human/Computer Interaction. I care about accessibility, intuitive interfaces and a good UX. I believe in writing DRY code, good commenting and collaboration among developers. I have experience in object-oriented programming, writing modular code and tackling each task, no matter how small, with commitment and a detail-oriented attitude.",
